      Every member is expected to follow these rules to ensure our community
      remains welcoming and respectful:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>No Begging or Harassment:</strong> Do not beg or DM clan members
        for free items, money, or any form of assistance. Harassment of any kind
        will not be tolerated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Respect and Courtesy:</strong> Treat all members with kindness
        and respect, and avoid offensive language and behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Spamming:</strong> Keep our conversations clean and easy to
        follow. Please do not disrupt discussions with irrelevant or repetitive
        messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Macroing or Automation:</strong> Third-party software or
        automation of any kind is strictly forbidden. Fair play is expected at
        all times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Deception:</strong> Honesty and integrity are crucial. Do not
        trick, lure, or otherwise deceive people.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Unwanted Advertising:</strong> Sharing or advertising
        harmful, indecent, mature content, or competing addresses or handles is
        not allowed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Discord and Runescape Name Consistency:</strong> Your Discord
        name must match your Runescape Name. Impersonation will not be
        tolerated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Respect Privacy:</strong> Everyone has the right to their
        privacy. Do not reveal personal information about others without their
        explicit permission.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content Posting Guidelines:</strong> Ensure all posted content
        is appropriate and relevant. Offensive, disturbing or NSFW content is
        not permitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Politics or Controversial Topics:</strong> To maintain a

      <li>
        <strong>No Reinvites After Ban:</strong> If a member is banned, they are
        not allowed to be reinvited, even on an alternate account. Attempts to
        circumvent a ban will result in additional penalties.
