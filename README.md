# Foggers Clan Website

Welcome to the Git repository for the Foggers Clan Website! This site serves as a hub for all of our clan activities, events, and member discussions.

## Project Description

This project is a basic HTML/CSS website that serves as an online space for the Foggers Clan in the game Runescape. Here, clan members can learn about the latest events, engage with others, apply to join us, and read more about our clan rules and mission. 

**Note**: This website is currently in its initial phase, built with HTML and CSS. In the near future, we plan to upgrade the website to a full-fledged React.js application to provide a richer and more interactive user experience.
